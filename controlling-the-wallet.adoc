== Controlling the wallet

As we can see wallet component startup and shutdown is largely driven from outside the wallet codebase from _src/init.cpp_.

Once the wallet component is started and any wallets supplied via argument have been verified and loaded, wallet functionality ceases to be called from _init.cpp_ and instead is controlled using external programs in a number of ways.
The wallet can be controlled using `bitcoin-cli` or `bitcoin-qt` GUI, and wallet files can be interacted with using the stand-alone `bitcoin-wallet` tool.

Both `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` run a (JSON) RPC server which is ready to service, amongst other things, commands to interact with wallets.
The command line tool `bitcoin-cli` will allow interaction of any RPC server started by either `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt`.

TIP: If using `bitcoin-qt` there is also an RPC console built into the GUI or you can run with `-server=1` to allow access via `bitcoin-cli`.

If using the `bitcoin-qt` GUI itself then communication with the wallet is done directly via qt's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v23.0/src/qt/walletmodel.h#L51-L52[`WalletModel` interface^].

Commands which can be used to control the wallet via RPC are listed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v23.0/src/wallet/rpc/wallet.cpp#L662-L731[_rpc/wallet.cpp_^].

=== Wallet via RPC

If we take a look at the https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v23.0/src/wallet/rpc/wallet.cpp#L195-L238[`loadwallet` RPC^] we can see similarities to ``WalletClientImpl``'s `LoadWallets()` function.

However this time the function will check the `WalletContext` to check that we have a wallet context (in this case a reference to a chain interface) loaded.
Next it will call https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v23.0/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L260-L271[`wallet.cpp#LoadWallet`^] which starts by grabbing `g_loading_wallet_mutex` and adding the wallet to `g_loading_wallet_set`, before calling https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v23.0/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L227-L257[`LoadWalletInternal`^] which adds the wallet to `vpwallets` and sets up various event notifications.

Further operation of the wallet RPCs are detailed in their man pages, but one thing to take note of is that whilst `loadwallet()` (and `unloadwallet()`) both take a `wallet_name` argument, the other wallet RPCs do not.
Therefore in order to control a specific wallet from an instance of `bitcoin{d|-qt}` that has multiple wallets loaded, bitcoin-cli must be called with the `-rpcwallet` argument, to specify the wallet which the action should be performed against, e.g. `bitcoin-cli --rpcwallet=your_wallet_name getbalance`

=== Via `bitcoin-cli` tool
